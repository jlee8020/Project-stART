# Developer Ah-ha Moments 💡

- “Everything I thought was going to be hard wasn’t that bad and everything I thought was going to be easy was more difficult.” Brandon Carter
- “I learned I much prefer postgresql to mongodb, and I don’t really like when django tries doing things for me. Materialize can be extremely frustrating.” David Stinson
- “It’s not so much as to how I want the app to look, a great product made by collaboration is more important than what I want.” Jan Lee

# User Stories 👩‍💻👨‍💻

- Mystica is a curious traveler from the far away Neverland. She heard about Austin’s SXSW and headed there to experience the festivities. When Mystica landed at the airport news of SXSW being cancelled greeted her… Oh no! She frantically searched the internet for fun things to do in Austin. According to Google she could 1. Get wasted on dirty six, 2. Try several breweries in East Austin or 3. download stART app and visit all the great arts in Austin. Well, Mystica was looking forward to a memorable experience in Austin plus she has allergic reaction to alcohol, so stART saves her day!!
