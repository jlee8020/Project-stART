# User Stories 👩‍💻👨‍💻

- Mystica is a curious traveler from the far away Neverland. She heard about Austin's SXSW and headed there to experience the festivities. When Mystica landed at the airport news of SXSW being cancelled greeted her... Oh no! She frantically searched the internet for fun things to do in Austin. According to Google she could 1. Get wasted on dirty six, 2. Try several breweries in East Austin or 3. download stART app and visit all the great arts in Austin. Well, Mystica was looking forward to a memorable experience in Austin plus she has allergic reaction to alcohol, so stART saves her day!!
